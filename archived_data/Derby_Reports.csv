"954","2018-04-19","Thank you to all that came to the Huntsman event, it was wonderful to see you there supporting our efforts. We also had Collect A Sig which was the tightest competition yet, with ties for first and second place! Come out today to our table sit in front of the Clark Gym. Guess the number of gummy horses in a jar, points will be based on the closest guess from each chapter, closest chapter gets the gummies! You can also pick up/pay for your shirts at the table sit. Donations are factored in and will make a big difference coming into the end of the week. Lets finish the week out strong!

"954","2018-04-20","Thank you all for an amazing week whether it was through your donations or your time coming out to the events. As of writing this we have raised over fourteen thousand dollars for Huntsman and we plan to carry that momentum until we reach at least twenty. We could not have had such a fun and successful week without all of you!","Gummy Horses & T Shirts","[    { ""N"" : ""10"" }  ]","true"
